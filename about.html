            <p id="art">I have been drawing since the age of 5- when I had discovered Leonardo Da Vinci's work in my parent's Encyclopedia.  I was fascinated and would stare for hours at his paintings, splayed across the floor with my nose just inches away from the page.  I would try to imagine his painting process and by staring, I was hoping it would uncover clues on how he did it.  I was imagining which strokes came first and what he did next.  It was a mystery I had to solve!  I wanted to learn!  Many art classes and many years later, I can honestly say I figured out his secret.  The realistic style still influences my art to this day.</p><br>

            <p>I currently hold a Bachelor's Degree in Art in General Studio from Cal State Fullerton.  Though the majority of my classes focused on graphic design and illustration, my first love was (and always will be) painting.  Receiving my Bachelor's Degree was an enormous feat for me, as it took me over 15 years to accomplish.  As a single parent of four, I went to school part-time- while working full-time- with summer break the times that I chose to recoup.</p><br>
            <p> I truly believe with determination, perserverance, and a plan, you can accomplish anything!</p><br>

            <p>After 25 years with an amazing company, I "retired" early this year so I could try something new that would fit my skills and personality and my love for problem-solving. I went back to school (again!) to learn web programming!  I am so excited for this new journey!</p>

            <p>I love learning (can you tell!?), technology (I'm addicted to my laptop.), traveling, everything art (especially street art), reading about cultures, textile designs, and tattoos!</p><br>

            <p>I'm introverted, totally shy, love to laugh, dance (when noone's looking) and hate talking about myself.  Come say hi to me!</p><br>

            <p>You could find me around art functions getting my nose as close as possible to the art (still!!) and eventually at more tech meetups.  Gotta keep learning!  (I do drag my hubby with me.  He loves it, I promise!  He worked at Spacex and now at an electric car startup, so people love to talk to him...which makes me feel like I'm socializing since I'm sort of in the conversation too).  Haha!
            </p><br>

            <p>But enough rambling, check out my illustrations and my tech projects.  And then hire me!</p>
